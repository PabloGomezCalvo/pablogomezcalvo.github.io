This Web Page is a personal website used as a portfolio with the main projects I have done in my Game Development Studies at University.
For this website I have learned how to use Node.js, Visual Studio Code, SASS/CSS.

The code is completly free and I will still updating it and improving it with new things I learn.

I hope you give it a chance!
